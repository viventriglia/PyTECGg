## What is it?

PyTECal is a fast, lightweight Python package that helps **reconstruct and calibrate** the [Total Electron Content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_electron_content) (TEC) from **GNSS data**.

Why calibration matters? Because without it, you don‚Äôt actually know the true value of TEC ‚Äî only how it changes. Uncalibrated TEC is affected by unknown biases from satellites and receivers, as well as other sources of error.

This package:
- is open source: read and access all the code!
- supports all modern GNSS constellations, codes and signals:
    - GPS, Galileo, BeiDou and QZSS
- supports RINEX V2-3-4
- provides seamless de-compression for RINEX files
