## What is it?

PyTECGg is a fast, lightweight Python package that helps **reconstruct and calibrate** the [Total Electron Content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_electron_content) (TEC) from **GNSS data**.

Why calibration matters? Because without it, you don‚Äôt actually know the true value of TEC ‚Äî only how it changes. Uncalibrated TEC is affected by unknown biases from satellites and receivers, as well as other sources of error.

This package:
- is open source: read and access all the code!
- supports all modern GNSS constellations, codes and signals:
    - GPS, Galileo, BeiDou, GLONASS and QZSS
- supports RINEX V2-3-4
- provides seamless de-compression for RINEX files

## Example usage

### Read RINEX files ‚Äî fast ‚ö°

```python
from pytecggrs import read_rinex_nav, read_rinex_obs

# Read a RINEX navigation file
nav_dict = read_rinex_nav("./path/to/your/file.rnx")

# Read a RINEX observation file, and extract receiver position and RINEX version
obs_data, rec_pos, rinex_version = read_rinex_obs("./path/to/your/file.rnx")
```

### Prepare Satellite Ephemerides üõ∞Ô∏è

```python
from pytecgg.satellites.ephemeris import prepare_ephemeris

ephem_dict = prepare_ephemeris(nav_dict, constellation='Galileo')
```

Supported constellations are: ```'Galileo', 'GPS', 'GLONASS', 'BeiDou'```

### Compute Satellite Coordinates üß≠

```python
from pytecgg.satellites.positions import satellite_coordinates

# Compute the position of a Galileo satellite (space vehicle #25)
satellite_coordinates(ephem_dict=ephem_dict, sv_id='E25', gnss_system='Galileo')
```
